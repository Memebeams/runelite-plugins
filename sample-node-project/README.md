## How to Use This Project
1. Have Yarn installed (its just a nicer `npm`)  
    1. Have Node installed
    2. `npm i -g yarn`
    3. Yarn is now installed
2. Navigate to `runelite-plugins/sample-node-project`
3. Run the command `yarn` or `yarn install` to install dependencies
4. The `package.json` provides two scripts:  
    - `build` - Compiles the TypeScript in `/src` and puts the resulting JavaScript files in `/dist`
    - `start` - Compiles as in `build`, then runs `node ./dist/main.js`
